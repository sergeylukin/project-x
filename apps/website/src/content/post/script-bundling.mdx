By default,Â `<script>`Â tags are processed by Astro.

- Any imports will be bundled, allowing you to import local files or Node modules.
- The processed script will be injected into your pageâ€™sÂ `<head>`Â withÂ [`type="module"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).
- TypeScript is fully supported, including importing TypeScript files.
- If your component is used several times on a page, the script will only be included once.
- ```
  <script>
    // Processed! Bundled! TypeScript-supported!
    // Importing local scripts and Node modules works.
  </script>
  ```

```

To avoid bundling the script, you can use theÂ `is:inline`Â directive.
* ðŸ“š See ourÂ [directives reference](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#script--style-directives)Â page for more information about the directives available onÂ `<script>`Â tags.
```
